## New Documentation Structure

```
adboard_instructions/
├── PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md      ← All instructions for building the project
├── ARCHITECTURE.md              ← Architecture, file structure, system design
├── DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md     ← All checklists and TODOs
├── PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md    ← Project status analysis
└── CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md    ← This file
```

---

## How to Use the New Documentation

### For Quick Setup (30 minutes)
1. Read: **PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** (Quick Start section)
2. Reference: HTML wireframe for exact styling
3. Use: Quick Reference section in PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md

### For Complete Build (1-2 weeks)
1. Read: **PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md** (complete guide)
2. Follow: **DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md** (phase-by-phase)
3. Reference: **ARCHITECTURE.md** (for file locations and structure)

### For Specific Questions
- **"How do I build X feature?"** → PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- **"Where is the code for X?"** → ARCHITECTURE.md
- **"What's the checklist for X?"** → DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- **"What's the project status?"** → PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md
- **"How do I deploy?"** → PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (Deployment section)
- **"How do I set up Cloudinary?"** → PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (Cloudinary section)
- **"What categories are supported?"** → ARCHITECTURE.md (Configuration section - 35 categories listed)
