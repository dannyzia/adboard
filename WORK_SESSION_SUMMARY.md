AdBoard — Work Session Summary
Date: 2025-10-26

Purpose
- Finish front-end work for Post Ad dynamic form, add tests and CI, and perform a manual smoke test of end-to-end flow.

Quick status
- Frontend: changes implemented in `src/pages/PostAdPage.tsx` to render category-driven dynamic fields, price/priceType/currency handling, image file uploads and image URL input.
- Backend: running locally (http://localhost:5000) during this session; returned location data and accepted test POSTs.
- Tests: Vitest unit tests added and passed locally (2 tests in `src/pages/__tests__/PostAdPage.test.tsx`).
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow added at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Files changed / added (important ones)
- src/pages/PostAdPage.tsx — replaced/refactored Post Ad form (dynamic fields, image upload, image URLs, price/priceType/currency, validation, payload merging)
- src/config/categoryFields.ts — mapping of categories -> field labels
- src/services/upload.service.ts — uploadImages(files, onProgress?) with retry/backoff
- src/services/location.service.ts — (unchanged) used by getCountries/getStates/getCities helpers
- src/pages/__tests__/PostAdPage.test.tsx — Vitest unit tests (mocks included)
- src/setupTests.ts — global test setup for Vitest + Testing Library
- package.json — scripts added: test, test:watch, test:ci
- .github/workflows/ci.yml — CI job for lint, tests, build
- .env.example — VITE_API_URL and Cloudinary placeholders

What I verified
- Vite dev server (frontend) can run: http://localhost:5173/
- Backend API responded to:
  - GET /api/locations/countries — returned 50 countries
  - GET /api/locations/states/United%20States — returned US states
- I executed a smoke flow attempt (register → login → create ad). The interactive terminal truncated the output once; you can re-run the exact PowerShell snippet below to reproduce locally.
- Vitest tests passed locally: 2 tests (PostAdPage basics).

How to resume when you get back
1) Start the backend (run from project root or backend folder):

PowerShell
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\callz\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Websites\adboard\backend"
npm ci    # if you haven't installed dependencies recently
npm run dev
```

This starts nodemon → server.js and the API should be available at http://localhost:5000.

2) Start the frontend (in repository root):

PowerShell
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\callz\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Websites\adboard"
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Vite will report the local URL (http://localhost:5173/). Open http://localhost:5173/post-ad to test the Post Ad UI.

3) Run unit tests locally

PowerShell
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\callz\OneDrive\Documents\My Projects\Websites\adboard"
npm run test:ci
```

4) Manual smoke test (register -> login -> create ad)

Run this PowerShell script in one command (it will register a temporary user, login, then create an ad):

PowerShell
```powershell
$ts = (Get-Date -Format yyyyMMddHHmmss)
$regBody = @{ name = "Smoke Tester"; email = "smoke+$ts@example.com"; password = "Password1"; confirmPassword = "Password1" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $regBody -TimeoutSec 30 | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5

$loginBody = @{ email = "smoke+$ts@example.com"; password = "Password1" } | ConvertTo-Json
$login = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $loginBody -TimeoutSec 30
$token = $login.token

$adBody = @{
  title = "Smoke Test Ad $ts"
  description = "This is a smoke test ad created at $ts"
  price = 9.99
  currency = "USD"
  category = "Electronics"
  location = @{ country = "United States"; state = "California"; city = "San Francisco" }
  images = @(@{ url = "https://example.com/smoke.jpg"; publicId = ""; order = 0 })
  contactEmail = "smoke+$ts@example.com"
  links = @{}
} | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/ads -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $adBody -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" } -TimeoutSec 30 | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

This will report the API response for ad creation; you can also run the same flow from the frontend by filling the Post Ad form and submitting.

Notes, caveats and next tasks
- The backend logged a Mongoose duplicate index warning earlier — non-blocking but worth fixing in the models if you want to clean warnings.
- Image URL items are added with `publicId: ''` in the payload. If backend requires a different shape, we can adapt (e.g., add `source: 'url'` or a `isExternal` flag).
- Pending UI work: per-file retry button for failed uploads; small accessibility/a11y audit; integration/E2E tests (MSW or Cypress) to remove dependency on local backend during CI.
- Pending verification: confirm backend accepts `details: Record<string, any>` shape for the dynamic fields. If you want, I can POST a sample ad that includes a `details` object to the API to confirm acceptance and persistence.

Where I left off
- Both frontend and backend were started during this session and tests passed. I attempted a smoke run; parts succeeded but the interactive terminal truncated some outputs — run the PowerShell smoke script above to reproduce the full responses.

If you want me to do anything before you leave the session
- I can commit these changes to a new branch (if you want a PR) and push it, or create a backup bundle of the changed files.
- I can add the MSW integration test now so CI covers submission flows.

Small checklist to finish next time
- [ ] Confirm backend accepts `details` payload and store/display in ad detail page
- [ ] Add per-file upload retry UI
- [ ] Add MSW integration tests or Cypress E2E for the submission flow
- [ ] Fix Mongoose duplicate index warning (optional cleanup)
